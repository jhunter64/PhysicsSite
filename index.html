		<h1>Hi! Welcome to physicscalculate.com</h1><br>
		<p>I'm a CS student at Georgia Tech, and I made this site to help with calculating complex physics<br><br>
			equations because I wasn't happy with other calculation sites I found. I hope you find it useful, and<br><br>
			there is a link to email me if anything goes wrong or you have an equation you want me to add!<br><br>
			I'm constantly updating the site as I have time, so any feedback is appreciated.<br><br>
			<a class="homeNote">Note:</a> this site was made for desktop use and will not render properly on a phone<br><br>
			<a class="homeNote">Note:</a> enter vectors as "[num], [num], [num]". Ex. "1, 2, 3"<br><br>
			LATEST UPDATE:
